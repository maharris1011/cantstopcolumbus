        On Sunday, March 15, 2020, the Columbus, Ohio tech and business community started
        talking about the idea of a virtual hackathon in response to the Covid-19 situation.
        With social distancing, no school, remote work, and a sense of urgency, thereâ€™s a lot of
        energy focused on helping. We proposed an online hacking event where anyone can
        contribute by defining challenges, building projects, and sharing resources.
